# Hi, Iâ€™m Tom ðŸ‘‹ 
**I'm a junior Software Developer working mainly with C#, JS/TS and React**

I've worked also with Swift, for iOS development, and C# for developing .NET Core applications. I have also worked with Java, having developed an Android mobile application
as well as for my Uni course.

I have published one app on the iOS App Store, and one on the Google Play Store, and hope to have a further product on the App Store within a couple of months.

I have completed freelance work for several small clients, mainly iOS development.
